# Outline
The aim of the exercise as submitted this week, was to read a list of names
from a file, a list of verbs from another file, and to combine them randomly
together, into pairs of noun verb combinations, which are printed to the
console.

E.g.

| Name | Verb |
|Sam | Eats|
|Mark | Writes|

Output:
```
Mark Eats
Sam Writes
```
